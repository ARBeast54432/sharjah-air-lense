# 🌍 Sharjah Air Lense

### 🚀 Developed by **Team Byte Me 💀**  
*A NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 Project*

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

**Sharjah Air Lense** is an interactive web app that monitors and forecasts **real-time air quality** by integrating data from **NASA’s TEMPO mission**, **OpenAQ**, and **Open-Meteo**.  

Our goal is to make air pollution data accessible, visual, and actionable for citizens, researchers, and policymakers — empowering local impact through global data.  

The app intelligently displays AQI levels, pollutant breakdowns, and live environmental trends, helping users take proactive health and policy decisions.

## 🎯 Why We Built It

Air pollution silently affects millions — yet reliable, easy-to-understand data is often missing for local areas like **Sharjah**.  
We wanted to **bridge that gap** using **science, technology, and creativity** — the very spirit of the **NASA Space Apps Challenge**.  

Our project naturally aligns with categories such as:
- 🧬 **Best Use of Science**
- 💾 **Best Use of Data**
- 💡 **Best Use of Technology**
- 🌐 **Local Impact**
- 🎨 **Art & Technology**
